Assignment during onilne internship with DLite (www.dlite.com)
A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behavior of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy. If a completely new user visits an e-commerce site, that site will not have any past history of that user.
